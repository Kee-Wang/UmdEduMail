# Purpose
A simple tutorial on how to use @umd.edu to send and receive email.

New students of UMD are initialized with a  `id@terpmail.umd.edu` email, which looks long and un-professional. However, you CAN actually using `id@umd.edu` to send and receive email. The steps I provide below works for me, it you are stuck at certain step, please feel free to tell me at keewang@umd.edu.


# Receive email using `id@umd.edu` 

* Here is already a nice [tutorial](https://umd.service-now.com/itsc?id=kb_article&sys_id=eea6516337a8420041271f9543990ec4) at schoool website. 

* All you need to do is to log-in testudo.umd.edu and change the  email in `contact information` into `id@terpmail.umd.edu`. 

* You will have to wait for at least 2 hours for it to take effect. 

* Please test by sending `id@umd.edu` using other emails. You might need to be able to receive from `id@umd.edu` to be able to send as `id@umd.edu`.



# Send email using `id@umd.edu`

This is a more exciting feature. The steps was inspired by a related [tutorial](https://help.eng.umd.edu/helpdesk/File/Get/5133820).


1. Log-in the [terpmail](http://mail.terpmail.umd.edu) on website and select `setting` on the right.

3. Select `Add another email address` under `Send mail as`. (Since I alraedy added `id@umd.edu` so you can see my `id@umd.edu`. However, for first-time user you can only see your `id@terpmail.umd.edu`.)

4. Enter your name and `id@umd.edu`. Unselect `treat as an alias`.

5. There are several settings.
    * SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
    * Port: 465
    * Username: `id@terpmail.umd.edu`

    You might see `Authentication failed. Please check your username/password and Less Secure Apps access for id@terpmail.umd.edu`. If you are absolutely sure your entered the correcet account/password combination, then it might be you have to authorize for `less secure apps`. So click on the hyperlink and follow the instruction.

6. You will receive a confirmation code send by `University of Maryland Team`. Enter the confirmation code and proceed. Notice, you might need to make sure your `id@umd.edu` can receive email so that you can receive the confirmation code.


7. After the success,  choose `id@umd.edu` as `default` under `Setting -> Account -> Send mail as`.
