# Purpose
A simple tutorial to show how to use `id@umd.edu` to send and receive email.

New students of UMD are initialized with a  `id@terpmail.umd.edu` email, which looks long and un-professional. However, you CAN actually using `id@umd.edu` to send and receive email. The steps I provide below works for me, if you are stuck at certain step, please feel free to tell me at `keewang@umd.edu`. 

**You will need to be able to access your `id@terpmail.umd.edu` before performing any of following steps. See  [terpmail](http://mail.terpmail.umd.edu) for guidance.**


# Receive email using `id@umd.edu` 

* Make sure you have access to `id@terpmail.umd.edu` before proceeding.

* Here is already a nice [tutorial](https://umd.service-now.com/itsc?id=kb_article&sys_id=eea6516337a8420041271f9543990ec4) at schoool website. 

* All you need to do is to log-in [testudo.umd.edu](http://www.testudo.umd.edu) --> go to `change address/email` -->  go to `contact information` --> change your application email into your `id@terpmail.umd.edu`. 

* You will have to wait for at least 2 hours for it to take effect. 

* Please test by sending `id@umd.edu` using other emails. 

* You might need make sure you can receive from `id@umd.edu` before being able to send as `id@umd.edu`.

3. Select `Add another email address` under `Send mail as`. (Since I alraedy added `id@umd.edu` so you can see my `id@umd.edu`. However, for first-time user you can only see your `id@terpmail.umd.edu`.)
